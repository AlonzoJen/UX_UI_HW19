        For as long as I can remember I have been a dreamer. My thoughts would take me into the 
        unknown, wondering how I could recreate the beauty that existed within the walls of my 
        imagination. Then I discovered the world of UX/UI design and I realized that I could indeed 
        breathe life into the beauty that this world has to offer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I invite you to catch a glimpse of the beauty that I can create. Keep in mind that my online 
        portfolio is just that, a glimpse. If you would like to see more, feel free to reach out to me!

        For this project, the task was to create a mobile prototype. 
        In this case, it was a mental health application that would 
        enable users to access help with ease.

        Government Agency Redesign:

      <p>
        Ever landed on a webpage that was shouting out for a makeover? 
        That is what this project was for, to breathe life back into a 
        government agency website. In this case it was for the 
        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

        Non-Profit Agency Redesign:
        Compass Connections
      </h7>
      <p>
        This project was one that I became very passionate about. The 
        agency is making such a positive impact on the lives of the 
        children that do not have a voice. Redesigning this website 
        will ensure more children get the help and resources that they 
        desperately need.
